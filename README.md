# General information

This repository is based on the following [repository](https://github.com/tranbahien/you-need-a-good-prior/tree/master). The structure of the repository is as follows:
1) The fully stochastic networks are in the folder "Full_stochasticity" and the partially ones in the folder "Partial_stochasticity".
2) Under the folder "Notebooks" you can find some notebooks that visualise the behaviour of the models on toy problems.
3) In the folder "Running" you can find different files to run experiments
4) The file transform_data.py can be used to transform the data to a valid format

If you want to reuse the code, please feel free to do so.
