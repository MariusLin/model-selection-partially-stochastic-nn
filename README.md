#General information

This repository contains the code for the paper "Enhancing Bayesian Neural Networks with Functional Priors and Partial Stochasticity through Deep Weight Factorization" and is based on the following [repository](https://github.com/tranbahien/you-need-a-good-prior/tree/master). The structure of the repository is as follows:
1) The fully stochastic networks are in the folder "Full_stochasticity" and the partially ones in the folder "Partial_stochasticity".
2) Under the folder "Notebooks" you can find some notebooks that visualise the behaviour of the models on toy problems.
3) In the folder "Running" one can find different files to run experiments

If you want to reuse the code, please feel free to do so but consider citing our work.
